# Mochi Boot Camp Session 3: SSG

TODO: overview presentation
TODO: example
TODO: can use new SSG if ready; examples can index into sorted list of IDs
  rather than using dense indexes directly
TODO: talk about SWIM, and maybe even have it "on" for default setup, but
  don't go into detail on it.  Most attendees aren't doing redundancy yet
