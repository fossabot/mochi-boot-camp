# Mochi Boot Camp Session 2: Hands-on

TODO: Phil handle JLSE setup/documentation

TODO: make content here first with step by step, details, packages.yaml,
  etc.

TODO: then make 5 minute presentation that summarizes and kicks off the
  session so people have the big picture of what they are setting up

TODO: have a few slides (not detailed) how to adapt this stuff for your home
  system.  Ask people not to start there, do JLSE first.  Exercise for the
  reader to get their laptop or home cluster set up.

TODO: initial example is a "hello world" rpc, something attendees can run
  without having to write code.  Bare minimum expectation to have executed
  this by end of session.

TODO: second example will be an exercise: copy the rpc, rename it, and
  modify it to do something else (increment an integer, for example)
